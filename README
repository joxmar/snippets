Snippets library.

Will create a snippest library where I can easily com and search saved snippets.
Features:
- snippets will be save under categories
- show all snippets and a list of categories links to display all those
- search and auto complete searchbox:
  should be able to search by snippet name or category

Tools to use:
Sintax highlighter https://craig.is/making/rainbows
auto complete https://tarekraafat.github.io/autoComplete.js/#/installation


Create new snippet:
copy an existing snippet from js/snippets/ and adjust to your new snippet info.

pay attenttion to the export, the const variable must be unique.
import the variable and file path.
add the variable to the allSnippets array

that's all



Move it later on to react
