Snippets library.

Will create a snippest library where I can easily com and search saved snippets.
Features:
- snippets will be save under categories
- show all snippets and a list of categories links to display all those
- search and auto complete searchbox:
  should be able to search by snippet name or category

Tools to use:
Sintax highlighter https://craig.is/making/rainbows
auto complete https://tarekraafat.github.io/autoComplete.js/#/installation

Where is the data stored???
as json 
{
  name: ''
  cats: []
  code: 
  language: ''
}

Structure:

categories list links
